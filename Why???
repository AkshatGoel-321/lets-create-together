Why you should contribute?
Contributing to an open source project helps you gain a much deeper knowledge about the software
Your first open source contribution may not be as easy as you might expect upfront, as it may involve one or more of the following steps:

determining which part of your solution is worth contributing
studying the contribution guidelines of the target project
obtaining and building the project
extracting the relevant code fragments
adapting the code and integrating the desired changes
providing the required level of automated test cases and documentation
filing an issue
submitting the change
While this may leave you questioning, whether it is worth the effort, there is a major benefit, that is often overlooked: Once you’ve gone through these steps, you will have gained a much deeper level of knowledge and understanding about the project at hand. In the end, it is nearly impossible to add new functionality or extend existing features, if you haven’t earned a thorough understanding about the concepts and principles, the project is based on.

Moreover, it is absolutely normal that your changes won’t be accepted in the first run. However, this way you get in touch with other experienced people working on the project, giving you valuable insights and feedback, as well. In fact, getting in touch with the people, who actually develop the code base of an open source project, is way more beneficial than talking to a sales representative of a commercial product.

Finally, all the knowledge gained through discussions with project members and by contributing actively to the code base represents an often underestimated competitive advantage for you and your company. Contributing to an open source project, in the end, lets you reach a higher level of expertise. Something that cannot be easily, if at all, achieved by simply reading books or using the project at hand.

Contributing to open source project helps your reputation and can leverage your career-

active open source contributions emphasize your expertise and knowledge, more than certificates alone will ever do. This is beneficial for advancing your career, be it at your current or an interesting, future employer.

Contributing to open source projects you are using in your projects lets you better deal with potential risks and plan for the future
Most software projects have a roadmap, that aims to help you to plan for the future. These usually include bug fixes and features at varying granularity lined up in a rough schedule, ranging from weeks to years. For commercial, closed source projects this roadmap, however, is of little help, when it comes to dealing with the risks of not finishing essential parts of it in time. Sales representatives are renowned for promising you all kinds of marvelous features to keep you at it. However, a sales representative rarely knows the risks that are actually associated with developing the feature, he just promised you, nor will he ever actively tell you about an end-of-life of his product.

Open source projects usually have a much more transparent roadmap, simply for the sake of collaborating with the contributors, who need to know, where the project is heading for. As such, when you actively contribute to open source projects that you actively use, you benefit from this transparency and are able to evaluate the risks associated with required features or bug fixes more precisely. Moreover, you can actively shape the roadmap (by contributing) or at least influence its prioritization. Ever successfully convinced a big commercial software company to accept your personal idea for the next major release?

Contributing to open source projects is fun and gives you personal satisfaction
Last but not least, contributing to open source projects can be a lot of fun, though challenging at first. While in your own projects you may be in the position to act quickly, when it comes to design or architectural decisions, there may be a lot more discussions in open source projects. Remember, that the best projects attract the best people, so when contributing to such projects, you are getting in touch with strong decision makers and very talented developers. It may be hard to convince them of your solution, the design you have chosen, or the usefulness for others. However, doing so successfully, will give you a much higher personal satisfaction than you may have expected.
